# 🧬 Observation – Ephemeroptera larvae (June 26, 2025)

This folder contains the photographic documentation of an **accidental discovery** of an *Ephemeroptera* larva (likely *Cloeon*, family Baetidae), collected unintentionally during sediment sampling in a stagnant upstream side-arm of the Ouvèze River.

---

## 📅 Field conditions

- 📍 Location: upstream oxbow of the Ouvèze River (pre-cascade zone, no current)
- 📆 Date & time: June 26, 2025, ~17:00
- 🌡️ Estimated in situ temperature: ~26–28 °C
- 🫧 Oxygen: <3 mg/L (measured in pot after 24h)
- 📥 Collection method: manual (no net), under rounded stones
- 🫙 Container: glass jar, cooled during transport

---

## 🔬 Larva identification (microscopy)

- Body length: ~10 mm
- 3 caudal filaments (cerci)
- Lateral lamellar abdominal gills (palmate, tracheobranchiate)
- Fusiform shape, compound eyes

➡️ **Conclusion**: *Ephemeroptera*, probably *Cloeon* (Baetidae)  
↪️ Species tolerant to moderate pollution but **sensitive to anoxia** — death after 24h confirms lethal stress conditions.

## 🧪 Scientific implication

This photo set demonstrates the feasibility of performing **proto-IBGN diagnosis using only a loupe, a jar, and an LLM**. It illustrates how **high-fidelity identification** and **eco-physiological interpretation** can emerge from a non-instrumental context, paving the way for **low-tech, high-cognition ecological protocols**.
